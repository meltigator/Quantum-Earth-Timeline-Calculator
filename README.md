# Quantum-Earth-Timeline-Calculator
Quantum Probabilistic Analysis of PlanetaryHabitability &amp; Extinction Events

This project combines physics, mathematics, and simulation. Structure analysis for scientific and realistic development.
Reliability Assessment
Level of reliability: Moderate-low for accurate predictions, but high educational and demonstrative value
Critical Factors:

Complexity of chaotic systems: Geological and astronomical events are difficult to predict in the long term
Lack of precise data: Many parameters would require continuous observations
Probabilistic nature: The result will be a statistical estimate, not a precise date

The project can be very valuable as:

Educational tool on planetary vulnerability
Simulation of "what-if" scenarios
Demonstration of complex probabilistic calculations

Factors to Consider

1. Geological Factors :

- Tectonic movement (supervolcano risk: Yellowstone, Campi Flegrei)
- Magnetic reversal (ongoing, could complete in 1,000-2,000 years)
- Global seismic activity

2. Astronomical Factors

- Asteroid impacts (NASA NEO database)
- Orbital variation (MilankoviÄ‡ cycles)
- Solar expansion (in ~5 billion years)
- Nearby supernova events

3. Climate Factors

- Global warming
- Ocean acidification
- Climate tipping points

4. Anthropogenic Factors

- Nuclear risk
- Bioengineering
- Uncontrolled AI
- Resource depletion

5. Quantum/Physical Factors

- Quantum vacuum decay (theoretical)
- Higgs field fluctuations
- Unexpected cosmic events

6. Monte Carlo Simulation

- 10,000+ iterations
- Probability distribution for each event
- Statistical aggregation of results

7. Quantum Component

- Using quantum fluctuations to model uncertainty
- Simulation of "wave function collapse" for critical events
- Entanglement between related factors (e.g., climate-geology)
